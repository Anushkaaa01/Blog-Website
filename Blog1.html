        <p>The ultimate productivity hack is saying no.

            Not doing something will always be faster than doing it. This statement reminds me of the old computer
            programming saying, “Remember that there is no code faster than no code.”

            The same philosophy applies in other areas of life. For example, there is no meeting that goes faster than
            not having a meeting at all.

            This is not to say you should never attend another meeting, but the truth is that we say yes to many things
            we don’t actually want to do. There are many meetings held that don’t need to be held. There is a lot of
            code written that could be deleted.

            How often do people ask you to do something and you just reply, “Sure thing.” Three days later, you’re
            overwhelmed by how much is on your to-do list. We become frustrated by our obligations even though we were
            the ones who said yes to them in the first place.

            It’s worth asking if things are necessary. Many of them are not, and a simple “no” will be more productive
            than whatever work the most efficient person can muster.

            But if the benefits of saying no are so obvious, then why do we say yes so often?
            Why We Say Yes
            We agree to many requests not because we want to do them, but because we don’t want to be seen as rude,
            arrogant, or unhelpful. Often, you have to consider saying no to someone you will interact with again in the
            future—your co-worker, your spouse, your family and friends.

            Saying no to these people can be particularly difficult because we like them and want to support them. (Not
            to mention, we often need their help too.) Collaborating with others is an important element of life. The
            thought of straining the relationship outweighs the commitment of our time and energy.

            For this reason, it can be helpful to be gracious in your response. Do whatever favors you can, and be
            warm-hearted and direct when you have to say no.

            But even after we have accounted for these social considerations, many of us still seem to do a poor job of
            managing the tradeoff between yes and no. We find ourselves over-committed to things that don’t meaningfully
            improve or support those around us, and certainly don’t improve our own lives.

            Perhaps one issue is how we think about the meaning of yes and no.The Difference Between Yes and No
            The words “yes” and “no” get used in comparison to each other so often that it feels like they carry equal
            weight in conversation. In reality, they are not just opposite in meaning, but of entirely different
            magnitudes in commitment.

            When you say no, you are only saying no to one option. When you say yes, you are saying no to every other
            option.

            I like how the economist Tim Harford put it, “Every time we say yes to a request, we are also saying no to
            anything else we might accomplish with the time.” Once you have committed to something, you have already
            decided how that future block of time will be spent.

            In other words, saying no saves you time in the future. Saying yes costs you time in the future. No is a
            form of time credit. You retain the ability to spend your future time however you want. Yes is a form of
            time debt. You have to pay back your commitment at some point.

            No is a decision. Yes is a responsibility.

            The Role of No
            Saying no is sometimes seen as a luxury that only those in power can afford. And it is true: turning down
            opportunities is easier when you can fall back on the safety net provided by power, money, and authority.
            But it is also true that saying no is not merely a privilege reserved for the successful among us. It is
            also a strategy that can help you become successful.

            Saying no is an important skill to develop at any stage of your career because it retains the most important
            asset in life: your time. As the investor Pedro Sorrentino put it, “If you don’t guard your time, people
            will steal it from you.”

            You need to say no to whatever isn’t leading you toward your goals. You need to say no to distractions. As
            one reader told me, “If you broaden the definition as to how you apply no, it actually is the only
            productivity hack (as you ultimately say no to any distraction in order to be productive).”</p>
