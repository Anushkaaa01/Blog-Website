        <p>The economist J.K. Galbraith once wrote, “Faced with a choice between changing one’s mind and proving there
            is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy with the proof.”

            Leo Tolstoy was even bolder: “The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he
            has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent
            man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.”

            What’s going on here? Why don’t facts change our minds? And why would someone continue to believe a false or
            inaccurate idea anyway? How do such behaviors serve us?
            The Logic of False Beliefs
            Humans need a reasonably accurate view of the world in order to survive. If your model of reality is wildly
            different from the actual world, then you struggle to take effective actions each day.

            However, truth and accuracy are not the only things that matter to the human mind. Humans also seem to have
            a deep desire to belong.

            In Atomic Habits, I wrote, “Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the
            respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival. For most of our
            evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast
            out—was a death sentence.”

            Understanding the truth of a situation is important, but so is remaining part of a tribe. While these two
            desires often work well together, they occasionally come into conflict.

            In many circumstances, social connection is actually more helpful to your daily life than understanding the
            truth of a particular fact or idea. The Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker put it this way, “People are
            embraced or condemned according to their beliefs, so one function of the mind may be to hold beliefs that
            bring the belief-holder the greatest number of allies, protectors, or disciples, rather than beliefs that
            are most likely to be true.”

            We don’t always believe things because they are correct. Sometimes we believe things because they make us
            look good to the people we care about.

            I thought Kevin Simler put it well when he wrote, “If a brain anticipates that it will be rewarded for
            adopting a particular belief, it’s perfectly happy to do so, and doesn’t much care where the reward comes
            from — whether it’s pragmatic (better outcomes resulting from better decisions), social (better treatment
            from one’s peers), or some mix of the two.”

            False beliefs can be useful in a social sense even if they are not useful in a factual sense. For lack of a
            better phrase, we might call this approach “factually false, but socially accurate.” When we have to choose
            between the two, people often select friends and family over facts.

            This insight not only explains why we might hold our tongue at a dinner party or look the other way when our
            parents say something offensive, but also reveals a better way to change the minds of others.

            Facts Don’t Change Our Minds. Friendship Does.
            Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing them to change their tribe. If
            they abandon their beliefs, they run the risk of losing social ties. You can’t expect someone to change
            their mind if you take away their community too. You have to give them somewhere to go. Nobody wants their
            worldview torn apart if loneliness is the outcome.

            The way to change people’s minds is to become friends with them, to integrate them into your tribe, to bring
            them into your circle. Now, they can change their beliefs without the risk of being abandoned socially.

            The British philosopher Alain de Botton suggests that we simply share meals with those who disagree with us:

            “Sitting down at a table with a group of strangers has the incomparable and odd benefit of making it a
            little more difficult to hate them with impunity. Prejudice and ethnic strife feed off abstraction. However,
            the proximity required by a meal – something about handing dishes around, unfurling napkins at the same
            moment, even asking a stranger to pass the salt – disrupts our ability to cling to the belief that the
            outsiders who wear unusual clothes and speak in distinctive accents deserve to be sent home or assaulted.
            For all the large-scale political solutions which have been proposed to salve ethnic conflict, there are few
            more effective ways to promote tolerance between suspicious neighbours than to force them to eat supper
            together.”

            Perhaps it is not difference, but distance that breeds tribalism and hostility. As proximity increases, so
            does understanding. I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln’s quote, “I don’t like that man. I must get to know him
            better.”

            Facts don’t change our minds. Friendship does.

            The Spectrum of Beliefs
            Years ago, Ben Casnocha mentioned an idea to me that I haven’t been able to shake: The people who are most
            likely to change our minds are the ones we agree with on 98 percent of topics.

            If someone you know, like, and trust believes a radical idea, you are more likely to give it merit, weight,
            or consideration. You already agree with them in most areas of life. Maybe you should change your mind on
            this one too. But if someone wildly different than you proposes the same radical idea, well, it’s easy to
            dismiss them as a crackpot.

            One way to visualize this distinction is by mapping beliefs on a spectrum. If you divide this spectrum into
            10 units and you find yourself at Position 7, then there is little sense in trying to convince someone at
            Position 1. The gap is too wide. When you’re at Position 7, your time is better spent connecting with people
            who are at Positions 6 and 8, gradually pulling them in your direction.

            The most heated arguments often occur between people on opposite ends of the spectrum, but the most frequent
            learning occurs from people who are nearby. The closer you are to someone, the more likely it becomes that
            the one or two beliefs you don’t share will bleed over into your own mind and shape your thinking. The
            further away an idea is from your current position, the more likely you are to reject it outright.

            When it comes to changing people’s minds, it is very difficult to jump from one side to another. You can’t
            jump down the spectrum. You have to slide down it.

            Any idea that is sufficiently different from your current worldview will feel threatening. And the best
            place to ponder a threatening idea is in a non-threatening environment. As a result, books are often a
            better vehicle for transforming beliefs than conversations or debates.

            In conversation, people have to carefully consider their status and appearance. They want to save face and
            avoid looking stupid. When confronted with an uncomfortable set of facts, the tendency is often to double
            down on their current position rather than publicly admit to being wrong.

            Books resolve this tension. With a book, the conversation takes place inside someone’s head and without the
            risk of being judged by others. It’s easier to be open-minded when you aren’t feeling defensive.

            Arguments are like a full frontal attack on a person’s identity. Reading a book is like slipping the seed of
            an idea into a person’s brain and letting it grow on their own terms. There’s enough wrestling going on in
            someone’s head when they are overcoming a pre-existing belief. They don’t need to wrestle with you too.</p>
